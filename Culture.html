			<p><br><br><br><br>Perhaps Japan's oldest martial art is Kendo, a combination of power, skill and bravery. The origins of Kendo can be traced back to the middle of the 11th Century where samurai and japanese swords emerged. These samurai would use Kendo as a way to practice and hone their swordsmanship. Today, Kendo is practiced all over Japan by people of all ages using swords crafted from four substantial bamboo slats held together by leather straps.</p>

			<p><br><br><br>Japan has a variety of religious beliefs that can be found in both Shintoism and Buddhism. Unlike religions such as Christianity and Mormonism in the West, religion is Japan is rarely preached. Instead it is more of a moral code, a way of living, almost indistinguishable from Japanese social and cultural values. Shintoism is Japan's original religion. It is the belief that every living thing in nature (e.g. trees, rocks, flowers, animals, and even sounds) contain gods to represent it. Shintoism is essentially the spirituality of this world and this life, whereas Buddhism is concerned with the soul and the afterlife. </p>
